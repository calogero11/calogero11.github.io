                Imagine...Imagine this. Dave is a incredibly motivated student and he wants to achieve top results and
                so do his parents but, he's at a little disadvantage. He has no technology and his parents wants to
                keep everything old school nevertheless the more he put effort in, the more he spent time revising, the
                more inefficient he was compared to his friends where they could find information rapidly instead Dave
                was at home wasting time through book, trying his best to find the precised information but still
                incapable to keep up. Do you really want to be a Dave?

                    When I was a child I didn't understand the power of technology until I gave my first instruction to a

                    acknowledging the technology around me programmed to help us, to make our everyday tasks easier and more
                    efficient. In addition I knew if I wanted to be a developer and achieve my dreams I had to be ahead of
                    my game as a developer's life is tremendously competitive...
